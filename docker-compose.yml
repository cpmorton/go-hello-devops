# Docker Compose configuration for go-hello-devops
# This file defines how to run both your application and the development environment
# together. Compose makes it easy to start multiple containers with a single command.

version: '3.8'

services:
  # The 'app' service runs your actual Go web application
  # This demonstrates the separation between the application itself and the
  # development environment. Your app runs in its own container independent
  # of the IDE.
  app:
    # We build the app from the Dockerfile in this directory
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.app
    # Map port 8000 in the container to port 8000 on your host machine
    # This means you can access the app at http://localhost:8000
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    # Set environment variables for the application
    environment:
      - PORT=8000
    # Restart the container if it crashes
    # In production, you'd use "always", but for development "unless-stopped" is better
    # because it won't restart when you deliberately stop it
    restart: unless-stopped
    # Container name for easy reference
    container_name: hello-devops-app
    # Mount the current directory into the container
    # This allows hot-reloading if you set up a file watcher
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    # Health check to verify the app is running correctly
    # Docker will periodically hit this endpoint and mark the container as unhealthy
    # if it doesn't respond correctly
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s

  # The 'devbox' service runs the devops-coderbox IDE container
  # This is where you do your actual development work
  devbox:
    # Use the pre-built devops-coderbox image from GitHub Container Registry
    # Once you've forked and customized devops-coderbox, change this to your own image
    image: ghcr.io/cpmorton/devops-coderbox:latest
    # Map port 8080 in the container to port 8080 on your host machine
    # Access the IDE at http://localhost:8080
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    # Set up environment variables
    # Replace these with your own values or pass them from your shell
    environment:
      - GIT_USER_NAME=${GIT_USER_NAME:-Your Name}
      - GIT_USER_EMAIL=${GIT_USER_EMAIL:-you@example.com}
      # If you want to use Claude CLI, uncomment and set your API key:
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
    # Mount the current project directory into the devops-coderbox workspace
    # This means when you edit files in the IDE, you're editing the actual
    # project files on your host machine
    volumes:
      - .:/home/coder/workspace
      # Optionally mount your SSH keys for git operations
      # Uncomment this if you want to use SSH for git push/pull
      # - ~/.ssh:/home/coder/.ssh:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: hello-devops-devbox
    # Run as the coder user (not root) for security
    user: coder
    # Keep stdin open and allocate a pseudo-TTY so you can attach to the container
    # and use the shell if needed
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true

# Networks are created automatically by Docker Compose
# Both containers will be on the same network, so they can communicate with each other
# by using the service name (e.g., the devbox can reach the app at http://app:8000)
networks:
  default:
    name: hello-devops-network
